A tool I wrote to parse and access the Chinese dictionary from the Taiwanese Ministry of Education.

I wrote this on a plane, so I didn't have access to the internet.
As such, I ended up writing my own XLSX parser using libzip and libxml2.

Included are 4 tools:
1. xml is a tool which dumps a tree view of any XML document.
2. zxml is a tool which dumps a tree view of any XML document at a given path within a ZIP archive.
3. xlsx is a tool which reads and presents a view of an XLSX document on the command line.
4. dict is a basic query system which reads the Chinese dictionary and displays definitions for queried items.

The idea is to make this into an app I can use on my phone with a nice interface.
There used to be such an app on the apple store, but it appears to have disappeared and it didn't have a very nice interface.
As part of this goal, I want to eventually convert the Excel document into a sqlite database.
Particularly, I'd like to parse the definition strings and make them more structured.
Currently, they're just flat strings in cells.
